### React code

- reusable - components, functions
- handle user interactions quickly and efficiently

### Virtual DOM

- DOM - document object model, interface of the rendered markup code (HTML, CSS)
- Virtual DOM - listens for changes on the DOM, identify where the change is happening, HTML elements are called nodes when looking at markup through the lens of the DOM
- SPA - single page application, made up of many components that come together to create a single view
- `<App />` - component invocation, component call
- JSX - JavaScript XML, markup language that can be written inside JavaScript, mostly looks and behaves like HTML
- React Fragment - `<></>` JSX elements with no content that create a wrapper without adding a node to the DOM
