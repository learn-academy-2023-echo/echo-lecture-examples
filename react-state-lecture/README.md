React State Lecture 7/31/23

- state is a special variable that holds data about the component that will determine how the component render or behaves 

- 2 types of components => Logical & Display 
    - Logical Components are components that hold data in state 
    - Display Components do not hold data in state 

- useState is a React Hook that allows us to add state to the component. It returns a state variable that will hold data and a setter function that is used to update the state value.
